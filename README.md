# Intervarsity
The Intervarsity Application was designed to allow students to fill out a contact card at the organization fair on 
the computer. The application then saves their contact card into a local folder on the computer that syncs up with Google 
Drive.  This allows other Intervarsity leaders to view, edit, sort the new members. The application also allows the leaders 
to copy all of the members email addresses at the click of a button to email all the members using their favorite email 
client.
